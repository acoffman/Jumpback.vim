# Jumpback

What is this?
---------------

This is an extremely basic VIM plugin I wrote that allows you to jump back to the most recent tab you were in while using GVim/MacVim etc.
I wrote it because I'd never written a VIM plugin before and I wanted to learn how. I also wanted to experiment with the Ruby bindings for vimscript.

While the plugin is fully functional I wouldn't recomend using it as you can accomplish what it does with 2 or 3 lines in your vimrc.

Eventually I hope to expand this into a fully functional tab management plugin once I have the time.


Installation
------------

Place jumpback.vim in the plugin directory of your .vim folder. If you use Pathogen (which I highly recomend) put it in jumpback/plugin in your bundles folder


Usage
------------

This will add a new command :Jumpback which will switch back to the tab you were most recently working in. 
You can bind it to any key you'd like
